# no "local uncommitted override" for it the way there is for a dev machine —
# so this swaps in the real identifier right after clone, before Xcode reads
# the project's build settings.

# Requires a Plain environment variable named RECEIPTS_BUNDLE_ID on this
# Xcode Cloud workflow: App Store Connect > Xcode Cloud > (workflow) >

# nor RECEIPTS_DEFAULT_SERVER_URL below need Secret — a bundle id and a
# server hostname are both already public (App Store listing, DNS), unlike
# AP_API_TOKEN previously.
